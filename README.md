A very simple text editor that supports multiple tabs. This isn't a very serious project, I wouldn't expect anyone to actually use this as their text editor :P

## Installation

This project doesn't need any additional modules.

## How to Use

The UI is quite simple. Open a new tab by either opening an existing document via `File → Open`, or creating a new one with `File → New`. When a large amount of tabs is open, only 5 tabs will be displayed at once. Click the `<` and `>` buttons to scroll through tabs. You'll be reminded to save changes when closing an unsaved tab or exiting the program.
